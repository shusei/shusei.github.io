You are refactoring a front-end anthropometry calculator.

Goal: add Japan/Korea adult local-norm datasets so the UI can label shoulder-to-height ratios by percentile.

Context:
- The site reads a manifest at `assets/data/datasets.json`, then loads per-dataset JSON files in `assets/data/anthropometry/`.
- Percentiles required: p10, p25, p50, p75, p90 for key `metrics.shoulderHeightRatio`.
- Each dataset file already contains sources and a `computedFrom` block describing how the ratio percentiles were derived.

Tasks:
1) Wire the new datasets into the existing selector without renaming keys (`shoulderHeightRatio`).
2) In the percentile rendering, prefer dataset p10..p90. If missing, fall back to p50-only display with a note (“此指標僅提供中位參考”).
3) Where a dataset includes `diagnostic`, ignore it in the UI but expose it in developer console for QA if `window.DEBUG` is true.
4) Update any locale labels to show “在地常模（JP/KR）” accordingly.
5) Keep metric math unchanged; do NOT divide univariate percentiles—use the dataset-provided ratio percentiles.

Sanity tests:
- Selecting JP/KR changes the percentile markers but leaves user-entered numbers untouched.
- Switching between male/female updates labels and ranges.
- No console errors when datasets have extra fields (`diagnostic`).

Deliverables:
- Code diffs for manifest loading and selector options.
- Minimal UI copy updates.
